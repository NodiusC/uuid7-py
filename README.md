# uuid7-py
This repository provides a single-file drop-in for generating UUID version 7. It is directly sourced from the CPython `uuid` module (with changes introduced in Python 3.14) as outlined in the attached file. It is a **temporary solution** meant for use until Python officially releases a stable version of 3.14.

## Usage
Simply copy the `uuid7.py` file into your project directory and import it as follows:
```
>>> import uuid7 as uuid

>>> uuid.uuid7()
UUID('00976400-be40-7de7-a772-38c88bd11b81')
```

## Attribution and References
This code includes portions of the Python `uuid` module from the CPython source code.
The implementation of UUID version 7 is based on the following commits:
- [Commit 3929af5e3a203291dc07b40c9c3515492e3ba7b4](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/3929af5e3a203291dc07b40c9c3515492e3ba7b4): Add support for UUID version 7 (RFC 9562)
- [Commit 1121c80fdad1fc1a175f4691f33272cf28a66e83](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/1121c80fdad1fc1a175f4691f33272cf28a66e83): Improve performance of `UUID.hex` and `UUID.__str__`
